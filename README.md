🕒 Pomodoro Timer  A simple and elegant Pomodoro Timer built with Python and Tkinter. This app helps you stay focused and productive by using the classic Pomodoro Technique, alternating focused work sessions with short and long breaks.

🚀 Features

✅ Start and reset timer easily
✅ Automatic transitions between work and break sessions
✅ Visual progress with checkmarks for completed work sessions
✅ Customizable work, short break, and long break durations
✅ Clean, minimal Tkinter UI

🧠 How It Works

The timer cycles through these sessions:

Work session → Focus for 25 minutes (default is 1 min for testing)

Short break → Take a 5-minute rest

Work session → Repeat!

After 4 work sessions → Long break (20 minutes)
